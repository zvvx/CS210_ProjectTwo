# CS210_ProjectTwo

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is my second C++ project for my CS210 class at SNHU. This project is an interest calculator that takes in user input for an initial investment, monthly deposit, and %APY which is then compounded monthly over the course of the years entered. The calculations for each year are then outputted to the console.

# What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I did a good job on making my code clear and readable. Comments are spread throughout the different files for added understanding.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In this project, there are just too many files for a simple interest calculator. In the future I will ensure that my projects are modeled closer to real world entities. Classes should be more alligned with real world objects and their properties. This should make my code more efficient and simpler for anyone to understand.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code to write would be the interest calculator methods themselves. I had to properly understand how to utilize a for-loop nested inside another for-loop in order to ensure the interest was compounded monthly. After understanding that, I can now use this project as a resource to help me understand future endeavors.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe the most important skills that will be particularly useful for future projects would be the knowledge of how to use classes. While I may have not used them correctly, I understand how to use the correct C++ syntax and inheritance. I also understand how to create and use the methods inside classes.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used industry best practices for naming my variables, methods, and classes. I also added helpful comments throughout the project that allow anyone to understand my thought process behind my code. It should be easy for anyone to change or add to my code.
